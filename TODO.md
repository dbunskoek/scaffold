# TODO

- do not copy some predefined files & folders (.git, .DS_Store, template-README.md)
- add .scaffoldrc with presets (author, etc.)
- make scaffold runs repeatable by storing and reusing input
- also allow reading template directory from a Git repo
- instead of always creating a new output directory, allow overwriting / merging files in an existing directory (use a hidden .scaffold directory with the latest scaffolded output directory?)
- combine multiple (modular) templates into one - or maybe just combine compontents using Jinja?
